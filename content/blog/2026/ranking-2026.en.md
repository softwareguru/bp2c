**Mexico City, February 5, 2026.**– Best Place To Code® (BP2C) today announced the official release of the BP2C 2026 Ranking, the list that recognizes leading companies in the technology industry as the best places to build a professional career in software and technology.

The ranking is based on an evaluation process that analyzes the real experience of tech teams within organizations, considering factors such as culture, leadership, professional development, inclusion, stability, perks, and workplace climate. Unlike other recognitions, BP2C prioritizes the voice of the people who live the culture every day: developers, technical leaders, and anyone involved in the technology area.

“In a context marked by the adoption of artificial intelligence, organizational restructuring, and new work models, companies more than ever need to build strong, human, and sustainable cultures. The BP2C 2026 Ranking shows that this is possible,” said Pedro Galván, creator of the program.

### A Ranking That Reflects Change in the Industry

The BP2C 2026 Ranking arrives at a key moment for the technology sector. The industry is undergoing profound transformations—from the redefinition of roles driven by AI to new talent expectations around leadership, purpose, and stability.

The companies featured in the ranking stand out for:

* Actively measuring and listening to their tech teams
* Making decisions based on data, not perceptions
* Investing in culture, development, and well-being
* Adapting to change without losing their human focus
* Emphasizing transparency, data, and the voice of talent

The BP2C evaluation is not a formality or an automatic certification. It is a rigorous process designed to provide organizations with a clear diagnosis of their strengths and areas of opportunity, while also giving tech talent reliable information to make better decisions about where to work.

This ranking is not marketing. It is the result of companies that are doing things right and that understand culture as a real competitive advantage.

The Best Place To Code program has become a benchmark in the sector by highlighting and recognizing companies that prioritize both innovation and the well-being of their employees. All technology companies can obtain their accreditation through the evaluation and audit process. More information is available at: bestplacetocode.com.

There, visitors can explore accredited companies, review their profiles, and understand what they are doing differently to attract and retain technology talent.
