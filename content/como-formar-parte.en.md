<h2>What is the process to be a Best Place to Code?</h2>

<p>You must complete the following process to be part of the Best Place to Code program:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Acquire survey.</li>
	<li>Share survey.</li>
	<li>Validate survey.</li>
	<li>Purchase membership.</li>
	<li>Get results.</li>
</ol>

<p>The different steps of the process are detailed below:</p>

<h3>1. Acquire survey</h3>

<p>To sign up for the survey, you must purchase the <a href="https://tienda.sg.com.mx/product/bp2c-evaluacion/">Best Place to Code: Evaluation product</a> from the Software Guru online store. The price varies depending on the number of people in IT roles:</p>

<p>(all prices are plus VAT for companies based in Mexico).</p>

<p dir="ltr">Surveys are available throughout the year. You can request a survey of your company at any time.</p>

<h3>2. Share survey</h3>

<p>Once you sign up, we will provide you with an information package so that you can share the evaluation with your employees. This includes instructions for your company staff to answer the survey.</p>

<p>Considerations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You must provide Software Guru with some evidence of dissemination of the survey in a general way. Examples: E-mail to the entire company (or to the technology area), message on the technology area's communication channel (Slack, internal forum).</li>
	<li>Each person who answers the survey needs to authenticate by means of an email and said email must correspond to the domain of the company in question.</li>
	<li>The survey must be answered by a minimum number of people in technology roles: 5 for micro companies, 20 for small companies, 50 for medium companies and 60 for large or global companies.</li>
</ul>

<p>The time to complete the survey and answer the questions will be 15 calendar days from when the company begins the deployment.</p>

<h3>3. Survey Validation</h3>

<p>Once the survey application period is over, Software Guru will have 5 business days to validate the answers and deliver the results to the company. These results will contain aggregated data, but not individual responses.</p>

<p>The minimum criteria to be considered Best Place to Code is the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cover the minimum number of responses required according to the size of the company (see "Display evaluation").</li>
	<li>Obtain a minimum average grade of 75% in each of the categories.</li>
	<li>Obtain a minimum average grade of 85% aggregated across all categories.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the company meets the minimum criteria to be considered Best Place to Code then it will receive instructions to make the payment of its membership and from then on begin to receive the benefits of the program.</p>

<p>If the company does not meet the minimum criteria, it can send out the survey again but must wait a period of at least 1 month after the delivery of results before doing so.</p>

<h3>4. Purchase membership</h3>

<p>Once a company meets the Best Place to Code criteria, it must cover the price of membership in order to be a part of the program and start receiving the benefits. This is an annual membership and like the survey, the price varies depending on the number of people in technology roles:</p>

			<td>
			<p><strong>Category&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Size (people in technology roles)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Price</strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			Micro
			</td>
			<td>
			Less than 10 people
			</td>
			<td>
			$720 USD
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			Small
			</td>
			<td>
			Between 10 and 100 people
			</td>
			<td>
			$1,320 USD
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			Medium
			</td>
			<td>
			Between 100 and 200 people
			</td>
			<td>
			$2,280 USD
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			Large
			</td>
			<td>
			More than 200 people
			</td>
			<td>
			$3,300 USD
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h3>5. Receive benefits</h3>

<p>Once the membership payment is received, Software Guru will ask the company for the necessary information to provide benefits (see "Program <a href="https://bestplacetocode.com/about/beneficios">Benefits</a>"). This includes the necessary information to create your profile within the Best Place to Code directory, as well as how to generate the information for company dissemination.</p>
