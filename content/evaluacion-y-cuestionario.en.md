## Assessment

<p>A fundamental aspect of Best Place to Code is the assessment used to determine if the companies meet the accreditation criteria.</p>

<p>A companyâ€™s individual collaborators are the ones that answer the survey, and it is they who determine if their company meets the criteria to be accredited as Best Place to Code. This not only gives the evaluation greater credibility but is also very useful for companies as a diagnosis that allows them to validate their strengths and areas of opportunity.</p>

<h3>How reliable and transparent is it?</h3>

<p>We have paid great attention to defining and implementing the evaluation mechanism to make it as transparent/reliable/practical as possible. Although there are already other programs or recognitions for "best companies to work for", Best Place to Code is distinguished in this area by 5 key aspects:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Companies that want to be accredited must first be evaluated by their own employees, who are the ones answering the survey.</li>
	<li>In order to answer the survey, it is necessary to have an email from the corresponding company.</li>
	<li>The answers are confidential, the company does not have access to them.</li>
	<li>Only a specialized SG contributor has access to the answers and validates that the people who answered yes are technical personnel and not just managers or HR staff.</li>
	<li>Not all companies that participate in the evaluation pass it. If this is your case, don't worry, we DO NOT publish non-passing results. But it is a fact that not every company manages to be a Best Place to Code, this process is not about paying for a membership and that's it.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Who participates?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>It is a bottom-up evaluation. That is, it is the company's employees who assign their rating and allow the technical staff of an organization to evaluate it and decide if it really is a place where they recommend other colleagues to work.</li>
	<li>It is designed for technology organizations. Not only software or IT services companies can be Best Place to Code but also companies of other sectors such as banks, retail, or entertainment. However, the survey for Best Place to Code only takes into account staff who collaborate in areas of technology.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What if my company does poorly on the survey? Who is going to find out?</h3>

<p>We only communicate to the general public when a company passes the evaluation and becomes a member of the program.&nbsp;We do not make public when a company does not pass, we simply give them the survey results (without personal data) so that they can use it as a diagnosis and improve, with the possibility of being evaluated again later.</p>

<h2>About the survey</h2>
