**Mexico, Mexico City, January 21, 2022.** - The Best Place To Code program, operated by Software Guru, finally revealed the companies best evaluated by its own staff members, which have become the places where many want to work in 2022

“Despite the pandemic, we have noticed that many companies continue to strive and transform their culture in order to face the great challenge of attracting and retaining talent. Some have achieved it and that is why we see new names on this list”, said Mara Ruvalcaba, Operations Director at Software Guru.

On the other hand, Pedro Galván, director of Software Guru,  rebuttals that there are companies that have developed a bad reputation because these types of profitable practices do not exist within them. Despite this some companies have devoted themselves completely to listening to their staff and improving in all aspects. “We know that there are companies out there that are known for the negative comments made by their former staff members and when they see their names on lists like these they wonder why or think they have paid to appear. However, we have seen the changes they have implemented and, at least in the evaluation of Best Place To Code, the same employees are the ones who decide (confidentially) if a place is good to work at as an IT professional”, he stressed."
