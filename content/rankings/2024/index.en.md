Mexico City, January 25, 2024 - The wait is over! As always, the Best Place To Code® program is thrilled to unveil the 2024 Ranking of the Best Technology Companies to Work for, where talent and workplace culture are at their peak.

### What Sets These Companies Apart?

* **Professional Development:** All companies in the ranking have shown a strong commitment to the continuous growth and development of their employees. Training programs, mentorship, and ongoing learning opportunities are continual.

* **Innovation and Cutting-Edge Projects:** These companies not only embrace innovation but lead it. Their projects are known for being challenging, spanning from artificial intelligence to emerging technologies, providing employees the opportunity to work at the forefront of the industry.

* **Inclusive Cultures:** Diversity and inclusion are fundamental values. The Best Place To Code not only talks about it but demonstrate it, fostering work environments where every voice matters, and every employee feels valued.

* **Gender-Friendly:** The Best Place To Code 2024 not only leads in technological innovation but also sets an example in valuing and respecting employees, regardless of gender, through fair compensation policies and gender-friendly practices. This reinforces their position as the best companies to work for in technology in 2024.

* **Compensation:** All companies in the ranking recognize the value of their employees and ensure that their efforts and contributions are rewarded fairly. It's worth noting that the salary range for each one is broad. In addition to competitive salaries, comprehensive benefit packages are common, including options for health insurance, company stock participation, and performance-based bonuses, to name a few.

### Updates in the Evaluation: Key Data

After addressing questions and concerns in this [Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1RDGlaoRZwVJL) (now X) regarding the Best Place To Code program, proposals, and contributions were also heard to make the evaluation more robust and end abusive companies' practices.

Among the key points considered for evaluation in this period are:

* The level of **empowerment** to make decisions in the company.
* **Comfort** in seeking help or support.
* **Consideration** of proposals or ideas from employees.
* Evaluation of mechanisms aimed at sharing **ownership or profits**.
* Policies regarding **remote versus in-person work**.

Additionally, a confidential and anonymous mailbox was included where employees of the companies can submit any comments, complaints, or suggestions, both about the evaluated company and the program itself.

And not to overlook the theme of inclusion, companies will have access to [SafeSpace Plus](https://safespace.global/), an innovative and holistic omnichannel solution to prevent misconduct and create a better organizational environment.

### Why Aren't There More Companies?

Ever wondered why some cool companies you're thinking about didn't make it to our list? Well, here are a few reasons:

* Not everyone's up for the challenge: Some companies just don't roll the dice and take this evaluation. Maybe they're just shy, who knows?
* They checked it out but opted out: Some companies took a peek but decided not to join the Best Place To Code club. Maybe they're rebels, doing their own thing.
* They tried but didn't make the grade: A few tried, but they didn't quite hit the minimum scores needed to pass. Tough crowd.
* They've got their own game going on: Some companies might have their own secret sauce or just like doing things their way.
* They're already winning other trophies: Maybe they're already part of other cool programs or bagged some other awards (even though Best Place To Code stands out, obviously).
* They're Living Under a Rock: Some just don't know this accreditation even exists. Can you believe it?
