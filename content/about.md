# About OSA COM

OSA COM is a community of open-source practitioners and evangelists specific to the Analytics space (in its broadest sense).  We bring together open-source project leaders, practitioners, patrons, and supporters in order to energize, connect, and support this community.  OSA COM is organized around a set of principles laid out in the Manifesto below.

Once a year, we organize OSA CON, a virtual conference where we showcase the best open-source projects, discuss technology trends, and help projects connect with users and supporters.

Why join OSA COM? (instead of the header a A Community of Communities for Open-Source Analytics). 
Below this would be the manifesto text
